Hunt rss feed for a particular topic.

measure structure and complexity for each article in rss feed.  Create a database to see trends over time.
- are particular topics have the same complexity for all rss feeds?
- is a particular feed uniform in complexity for all articles?


for a corpus, what are the topics it talks about?
    - what does Denver post talk about?
    - what does CNN talk about?
    - what does local paper talk about?
